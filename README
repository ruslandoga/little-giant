A little program that:

1. scrapes or ingests Prometheus metrics and saves the samples in a compact format to S3
   https://github.com/ruslandoga/little-giant/blob/master/explainers/prometheus-pull.md
   https://github.com/ruslandoga/little-giant/blob/master/explainers/prometheus-push.md

2. pretends to be S3 with predicate pushdown for ClickHouse and DuckDB
   https://github.com/ruslandoga/little-giant/blob/master/explainers/clickhouse-local.md
   https://github.com/ruslandoga/little-giant/blob/master/explainers/duckdb.md

3. renders markdown reports and dashboards with WASM
   https://github.com/ruslandoga/little-giant/blob/master/explainers/markdown-reports.md
   https://github.com/ruslandoga/little-giant/blob/master/explainers/markdown-dashboards.md

---------------------------------------------------
tl;dr: "free" metrics for the desperate, but then..
---------------------------------------------------

5. ingests logs and traces (also to S3)
   https://github.com/ruslandoga/little-giant/blob/master/explainers/vector-sinks.md

6. pretends to be Sentry
   https://github.com/ruslandoga/little-giant/blob/master/explainers/am-i-sentry.md

7. 8. 9. etc. TODO.

   little-giant could
   and didn't stop to
   think if it should

Anywho, FAQ

~ Q: ALERTS?
~ A: GITHUB ACTIONS:
  - download DuckDB or ClickHouse
  - compute a scalar value and check if it exceeds a threshold
  - exit 1 if it does, optionally post a message to slack/discord/telegram or open an issue
  - more ideas: https://github.com/ruslandoga/little-giant/blob/master/explainers/where-alerts-at.md

~ Q: network costs, slow queries?
~ A: CDN sandwiches:
 
     little-giant
           |
          CDN
         /   \
       S3   client

CDN in front of S3 (e.g. CloudFront) eats the bandwidth costs.
And CDN in front of little-giant keeps the data parts that DuckDB and ClickHouse operate on.
